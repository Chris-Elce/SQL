SELECT count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='TV Show';

SELECT country, COUNT(country)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
GROUP BY country 
HAVING COUNT(country) > 1

#2. How many movie titles are there in the database? 
SELECT count(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

#3. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#4. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#5. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc

#NOTE: Just in case two or more movies were made in the same year, we want to see ALL the past movies with the below subquery.  
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'); 

#7. What about all the "new" movie releases?
#NOTE: Multiple movie releases per year are the norm these days. Let's run another subquery to see all "new" 2021 movie releases. 
SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year >=
